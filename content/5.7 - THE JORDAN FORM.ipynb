      "source": "# The Jordan Form\nWe can take into account the generalized eigenvectors of a matrix in order to extend the\neigenvalue-eigenvector equation in matrix form, as follows. Let $A$ be a generic linear operator in\n$\\mathcal{U}$, with $\\dim(\\mathcal{U})=n$. Let $V$ be a matrix whose columns are the generalized\neigenvectors of $A$\n\nIf $A$ cannot be diagonalized, then the Jordan form provides the most simplified structure achievable via\nsimilarity transformations. Any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}$ can be transformed into a Jordan\ncanonical form $J$ through an invertible matrix $T$ such that:\n\n$$T^{-1} A T = J =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nJ_1 &        &        \\\\\n    & \\ddots &        \\\\\n    &        & J_q\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nEach $J_i$ is called a **Jordan block**, associated with eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_i$:\n\n$$J_i =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda_i & 1        &          &        \\\\\n          & \\lambda_i & \\ddots   &        \\\\\n          &          & \\ddots   & 1      \\\\\n          &          &          & \\lambda_i\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\in \\mathbb{C}^{n_i \\times n_i}$$  \n  \nThe matrix $J$ is block-diagonal, with the total dimension $n = \\sum_{i=1}^{q} n_i$. The goal is to choose $T$\nsuch that $J$ is as close to diagonal as possible.\n\nIf $A$ has a complete set of $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors, they can be placed in the columns of $T$\n(so $T = X$), and $X^{-1} A X$ is diagonal. In this case, the Jordan form of $A$ is simply a diagonal matrix.\nThis corresponds to the situation where each Jordan block has size 1. Note that the Jordan form is **unique up\nto the order of the Jordan blocks**. That is, although the arrangement of the blocks may vary, the number,\nsize, and associated eigenvalues of the blocks are uniquely determined by the matrix $A$.\n\nIn the general case where $A$ does not have enough linearly independent eigenvectors, the Jordan form still\nprovides a canonical representation. Suppose $A$ has $s$ linearly independent eigenvectors. Then it is similar\nto a Jordan matrix $J$ with $s$ blocks. Each block corresponds to one eigenvector and contains the eigenvalue\nalong the diagonal and ones just above the diagonal.  The number of Jordan blocks corresponds to the geometric\nmultiplicity of the eigenvalue, while the size and number of repeated eigenvalues relate to the algebraic\nmultiplicity. When the geometric multiplicity is less than the algebraic multiplicity, the Jordan form will\ncontain multiple Jordan blocks for the same eigenvalue, possibly of different sizes.",

      "source": "# Application: Markov Chains\nA Markov chain is a mathematical system that experiences transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. A Markov chain is also a stochastic (random) process, but it differs from a general stochastic process in that a Markov chain must be \"memory-less.\" That is, (the probability of) future actions are not dependent upon the steps that led up to the present state. This is called the Markov property. While the theory of Markov chains is important precisely because so many \"everyday\" processes satisfy the Markov property, there are many common examples of stochastic properties that do not satisfy the Markov property. The state space, or set of all possible states, can be anything (letters, numbers, weather conditions, etc).\n\n![image.png](https://d18l82el6cdm1i.cloudfront.net/uploads/8izeywKSRU-stochastic-process-not-markov.gif)\n\n![image.png](https://d18l82el6cdm1i.cloudfront.net/uploads/I1p8Np0BlO-stochastic-process-is-markov.gif)",
